# Tribal-Wars-API
This API is intended to automate Tribal Wars(a browser game) using C# 

V 1.0 - 03/10/2016
API is currently available only for Tribalwars Turkish version (Klanlar.org) world 32 (32. Dunya).
As the project gets developed, it might get to be more generic. 

The API consists two main elements:
- Buildings upgrade command
- Village attacking command

These two commands are the most basic commands that can used in many ways. For example you can create your own scheduler program that upgrades buildings or attacks villages on a specific time and date.
